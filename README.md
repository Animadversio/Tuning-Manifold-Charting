# Tuning Manifold Charting: the Official Code Base for the Manifold Paper: 


## Dataset Structure
Our formatted and reduced dataset is stored in `.mat` format as a structure array, which can be accessed from Matlab or Python. 

* Each experimental session has one struct corresponding to Evolution, and one struct corresponding to Manifold experiment. 
* Array is organized in the order of experiment time for each monkey. 

## Code Structure
Our analysis code is written in Matlab and Python. Matlab for most statistical analysis, Python esp. pytorch for the *in silico* experiment and modelling.

### Experimental Control
Our experiments are controlled by custom Matlab script using Monkeylogic, with the image generator in matlab. The manifold image explorations are generated by Python / matlab after the Evolution finish. 



### Statistical Analysis 
* Receptive field mapping. 
* Evolution trajectory, successfulness, best generation. 
* Tuning Map, basic stats (ANOVA, F statistics).
* Kent function fitting of tuning map, extract Kent parameters, population analysis of Kent parameter. (`analysis\Kent_func`)
* Image distance matrix measurement using LPIPS. 
* Radial Tuning curve, AUC for tuning curve. 
* Non-parametric statistics of tuning maps: Volume under the Surface (VUS), Peak location
* Measuring tuning map similarity by functional correlation on manifold
* Tuning map similarity as a function to cortical distance 

### Plotting 
* -> Figure 2B
* -> Figure 2C
* Plot
* Plot tuning maps in the same configuration as the electrode array. (Figure 5)
